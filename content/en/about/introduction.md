## Overview

This course introduces algorithms, statistical methods and data analysis programming 
routines relevant for genome biology. It consists of three main components:
lectures, hands-on practicals and student course projects. The lecture topics cover databases, sequence 
(NGS) analysis, phylogenetics, comparative genomics, genome-wide profiling methods, 
network biology and more. The hands-on practicals include homework assignments and 
course projects focusing on data analysis programming of next generation genome data 
using command-line tools on a computer cluster and the programming environment R. 
Depending on student interests, one or more specialty topics may be included, such
as the analysis of single cell (_e.g._ scRNA-Seq) experiments, multi-omics data, or 
the development of web-based analysis tools (_e.g._ Shiny Apps). 

## Who should take this class?

Students with a strong interest and motivation in acquiring the skills required for mastering
the computational aspects of modern genome research. The class is mainly
targeting graduate students but senior undergraduate students are welcome to
enroll as well. The main audience of this class usually includes students from
bioscience, biomedical and bioengineering programs as well as CS and statistics
students with interest in computational biology.

## Can I audit this class?

It is possible to audit this class. However, due to the emphasis on active participation
in practicals and course projects, students usually learn much more if they enroll into the
class rather than auditing it in a passive manner.

## Inclusive Classroom Code of Conduct

## Accessibility 

UC Riverside is committed to creating a learning environment that meets the
needs of its diverse student body. If students anticipate or experience any
barriers to learning in this course, they are welcome to discuss their concerns
with the instructor(s). If students have a disability, they may want to contact
the [Student Disability Resource Center](https://sdrc.ucr.edu/) to accommodate
their specific needs. As faculty we are responsible for collaborating with SDRC
to ensure that the students enrolled in our classes have access to the SDRC
