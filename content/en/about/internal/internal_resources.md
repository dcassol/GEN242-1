- Zoom URLs and course planning sheets: shared via an internal Google Doc named `URLs_to_Private_Info`.

- [GitHub Classroom](https://github.com/personal): homework assignments are distributed and autograded via GitHub Classroom.
- Course communication: depending on student preferences this class uses for group communications Piazza and/or Slack. This year the preference was to use only Piazza.
    - [Piazza](https://piazza.com/ucr/spring2021/gen242/home): for communication among students and instructor (please avoid email!)
    - [Slack](https://slack.com/): not used this year.
