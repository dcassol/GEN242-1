## A: create a private GitHub repository

In this homework, you are asked to create a github **private** repository.

1.  Login to your github.
2.  Click the "**New"** button from left sidebar.
3.  In "**Repository name"**, write **"learn-github"** as the name.
4.  Choose "**Private**".
5.  Choose to add a README file (optional).
6.  Click "**Create repository**".
7.  It should jump you to the new repo's page. In the new page, click "**Settings**".
8.  Click "**Manage access**", and the choose "**Invite a collaborator**".
9.  Invite both "**tgirke**" and "**lz100**" and send out the invitation.

</video>

Note, the creator of this demo cannot search for an invitation created by the same user
(here lz100). Thus, the message 'could not find `lz100` at the end of the video. This
will not be the case for students in the class.

No submission is required for this part (A).

## B: Databases and Software

This is an easy warm-up homework exposing students to a variety of online databases and software tools.

1. Go to [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov), select `Protein` database in dropdown, and then run query: `P450 & hydroxylase & human [organism]`, select under _Source_ databases UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot 

    1. Report final query syntax from _Search Details_ field. 

2. Save GIs of the final query result to a file. For this select under `Send to` dropdown `GI List` format. 

    1. Report the number of retrieved GIs.

3. Retrieve the corresponding sequences through [Batch-Entrez](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/batchentrez) using GI list file as query input -> save sequences in FASTA format

4. Generate multiple alignment and tree of these sequences using [MultAalin](http://bioinfo.genotoul.fr/multalin)

    1. Save multiple alignment and tree to file
    2. Identify putative heme binding cysteine in multiple alignment

5. Open corresponding [UniProt page](http://www.uniprot.org) and search for first P450 sequence in your list.

    1. Compare putative heme binding cysteine with consensus pattern from Prosite database ([Syntax](http://prosite.expasy.org/scanprosite/scanprosite_doc.html#mo_motifs))
	2. Report corresponding Pfam ID

6. [BLASTP](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/Blast.cgi) against nr database (use again first P450 in your list); on next two pages click on P450 and CypX domains, respectively (this runs RPS-BLAST). 
    1. Compare resulting alignment with result from MultAlin
	2. View 3D structure in Cn3D, save structure (screen shot) and highlight heme binding cysteine 

## Homework submission

Click [this link](https://classroom.github.com/a/uvuGwqec) to accept the homework.
It will create a private repository for you. 

Please assemble the results of this homework in one PDF file and upload it to your private homework1 GitHub repository and name it `hw1.pdf`.

Note: this new repository for the homework is **different** from the 
repository in part A. This repository
belongs to the `GEN242-2021` Github classroom. 

## Due date

Most homework will be due one week after they are assigned. This one is due on Thu, April 8th at 6:00 PM. You have unlimited attempts. You can edit/reupload files 
anytime before the deadline.
