## A. Online Excercise: Databases and Software Tools

This is an easy warm-up homework exposing students to a variety of online databases and software tools.

1. Go to [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov), select `Protein` database in dropdown, and then run query: `P450 & hydroxylase & human [organism]`, select under _Source_ databases UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot 
    1. Report final query syntax from _Search Details_ field. 

<p></p>

2. Save GIs of the final query result to a file. For this select under `Send to` dropdown `GI List` format. 
    1. Report the number of retrieved GIs.

<p></p>

3. Retrieve the corresponding sequences through [Batch-Entrez](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/batchentrez) using GI list file as query input -> save sequences in FASTA format

<p></p>

4. Generate multiple alignment and tree of these sequences using [MultAalin](http://bioinfo.genotoul.fr/multalin)
    1. Save multiple alignment and tree to file
    2. Identify putative heme binding cysteine in multiple alignment

<p></p>

5. Open corresponding [UniProt page](http://www.uniprot.org) and search for first P450 sequence in your list.
    1. Compare putative heme binding cysteine with consensus pattern from Prosite database ([Syntax](http://prosite.expasy.org/scanprosite/scanprosite_doc.html#mo_motifs))
	2. Report corresponding Pfam ID

<p></p>

6. [BLASTP](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/Blast.cgi) against PDF database (use again first P450 in your list); 
on result page click first entry in BLAST hit list (here [3K9V_A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein/3K9V_A?report=genbank&log$=protalign&blast_rank=1&RID=6BZUZS51016)); then select 'Identify Conserved Domains' on side bar; click blue bar labelled 'CYP24A1'; then select 'Interactive View' which will download 'cd20645.cn3' file.
    1. Compare resulting alignment with result from MultAlin
	2. View 3D structure in Cn3D, save structure (screen shot) and highlight heme binding cysteine. Note, Cn3D can be downloaded from [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/CN3D/cn3d.shtml). 


## B. Homework Submission to a Private GitHub Repository

To learn the basics of GitHub, this homework assignment will be uploaded to a private GitHub respository that will be shared with the instructors. To do so, follow these steps:
In this homework, you are asked to create a github **private** repository.

1.  Login to your GitHub account.
2.  Click the "**New"** button in the sidebar on the left.
3.  Under "**Repository name"**, use **"learn-github"** as the name.
4.  Choose "**Private**".
5.  Choose to add a README file (optional).
6.  Click "**Create repository**".
7.  You should redirected to your new repo's page. In the new page, click "**Settings**".
8.  Click "**Manage access**", and the choose "**Invite a collaborator**".
9.  Invite both "**tgirke**" and "**lz100**" and send out the invitation.

<video width="100%" height="100%" controls>
  <source src="https://github.com/GEN242-2021/class_notes/blob/main/week1/GitHub.mp4?raw=true" type="video/mp4">
</video>

Note, the creator of this demo cannot search for an invitation created by the same user
(here lz100). Thus, the message 'could not find lz100' at the end of the video. This
will not be the case for students in the class.

No submission is required for this part (A).

## C. Homework Submission via GitHub Classroom

Click [this link](https://classroom.github.com/a/uvuGwqec) to accept the homework.
It will create a private repository for you. 

Please assemble the results of this homework in one PDF file and upload it to your private homework1 GitHub repository and name it `hw1.pdf`.

Note: this new repository for the homework is **different** from the 
repository in part A. This repository
belongs to the `GEN242-2021` Github classroom. 

## Due date

Most homework will be due one week after they are assigned. This one is due on Thu, April 8th at 6:00 PM. You have unlimited attempts. Students can edit and re-upload files 
anytime before the deadline.
