## Topic: Databases and Software

This is an easy warm-up homework exposing students to a variety of online databases and software tools.

1. Go to [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov), select `Protein` database in dropdown, and then run query: `P450 & hydroxylase & human [organism]`, select under _Source_ databases UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot 

  1. Report final query syntax from _Search Details_ field. 

2. Save GIs of the final query result to a file. For this select under `Send to` dropdown `GI List` format. 

  1. Report the number of retrieved GIs.

3. Retrieve the corresponding sequences through [Batch-Entrez](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/batchentrez) using GI list file as query input -> save sequences in FASTA format

4. Generate multiple alignment and tree of these sequences using [MultAalin](http://bioinfo.genotoul.fr/multalin)

    1. Save multiple alignment and tree to file
    2. Identify putative heme binding cysteine in multiple alignment

5. Open corresponding [UniProt page](http://www.uniprot.org) and search for first P450 sequence in your list.

    1. Compare putative heme binding cysteine with consensus pattern from Prosite database ([Syntax](http://prosite.expasy.org/scanprosite/scanprosite_doc.html#mo_motifs))
	2. Report corresponding Pfam ID
	3. How many mouse (Mus musculus) sequences are in this family (use species tree from Pfam db)

6. [BLASTP](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/Blast.cgi) against nr database (use again first P450 in your list); on next two pages click on P450 and CypX domains, respectively (this runs RPS-BLAST). 
    1. Compare resulting alignment with result from MultAlin
	2. View 3D structure in Cn3D, save structure (screen shot) and highlight heme binding cysteine
