## Overview

Each student has been assigned one journal publication to present in class. The
expected structure of the paper presentations is outlined in this [Slideshow Template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1XxV5kseWrmPuLzk0x64_sRFDunyg40iMF2qSUCJ2vPE/edit). 
A detailed presentation schedule is available on the internal [Course Schedule](). 
The following lists the assigned papers organized by course project topics.
